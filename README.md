# Machine Learning Module
## Performance Metrics
### Description
A collection of Jupyter notebooks used during the Performance Metrics day, including context, comments, and solutions.

### Content
- `05-ML_03_Performance-metrics.ipynb`: The notebook used during the lecture's livecode.
- `Recap.ipynb`: A solution of the recap exercise. It differs from the solution from le Wagon, as theirs includes a step where the `cols_to_scale` list is defined, but not used after; the entire dataset is processed with `MinMaxScaler` instead.
